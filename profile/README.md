## About Fluid
Fluid is a desktop utility that converts websites into full-fledged standalone applications. It enables users to launch web services as independent desktop apps with their own window, icon, and settings. This enhances productivity by reducing browser tab clutter and providing focused access to frequently used platforms.

Fluid supports creating multiple isolated site-specific browsers with separate logins and custom configurations. Users can generate desktop apps for tools like messaging platforms, productivity dashboards, or cloud services and manage them outside standard browsers.
